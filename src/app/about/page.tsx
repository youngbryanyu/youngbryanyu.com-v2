        "I'm Young Bryan Yu. I grew up in San Francisco Bay Area (more precisely, Silicon Valley, home of Apple). I was born in Montana (middle of nowhere), but my family moved to California when I was around 5. I am interested in distributed systems, databases, and cloud computing. Currently, I am pursuing a MS in Computer Science at Purdue University. I received my BS in Computer Science from Purdue University as well.  I am currently working at startup at KeyByte LLC on some cutting edge database and VM tuning technologies. I have also worked at Amazon building services for Alexa devices. When I am not working I enjoy working out and playing all kinds of sports. I also enjoy reading and dabble in poker. I love traveling and trying new foods. I used to do photography but the busyness of life has gotten to me and I haven't had too much time for it lately.",
